    "description": "We collected surface seawater samples using trace clean 1L Nalgene bottles on the end of a long bamboo pole.   We will analyse these samples for trace elements.  Iron is the element of highest interest to our group.  We will determine dissolved iron and total dissolvable iron concentrations.  \n\nSamples collected from 7 sites:  \nSites 1, 2, 3, 4 were a transect perpendicular to the edge of the iceberg to try and determine if there is a iron concentration gradient relative to the iceberg.  \nSites 4, 5, 6 were along the edge of the iceberg to determine if there is any spatial variability along the iceberg edge. \nSite 7 was away from the iceberg to determine what the iron concentration is in the surrounding waters not influenced by the iceberg.",
