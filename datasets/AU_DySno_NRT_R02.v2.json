    "description": "The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on the Global Change Observation Mission - Water 1 (GCOM-W1) provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.  Near real-time (NRT) products are generated within 3 hours of the last observations in the file, by the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) at the AMSR Science Investigator-led Processing System (AMSR SIPS), which is collocated with the Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC) DAAC.  The NRT AMSR2 Unified L3 Global Daily Snow Water Equivalent data set contains snow water equivalent (SWE) data and quality assurance flags mapped to Northern and Southern Hemisphere 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grids (EASE-Grids).  Data are stored in HDF-EOS5 format and are available via HTTP from the EOSDIS LANCE system at https://lance.nsstc.nasa.gov/amsr2-science/data/level3/daysnow/.  If data latency is not a primary concern, please consider using science quality products.  Science products are created using the best available ancillary, calibration and ephemeris information.  Science quality products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earth's geophysical properties to support science.",
