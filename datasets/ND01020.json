    "description": "The objectives of ADEOS mission are to acquire data on worldwide\nenvironmental changes such as the green house effect, ozon layer\ndepletion, tropical rain forest deforestation, and abnormal climatic\nconditions, in order to contribute to international global\nenvironmental monitoring and to develop platform bus technology, inter\norbital data relay technology, etc. which are necessary for the\ndevelopment of future earth observation systems.\n\nTo make continuous, thorough observations of the entire earth surface\nand its atmospheres, the spacecraft carries two core sensors developed\nby NASDA: the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR)\nand the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS).  In addition, the\nspacecraft carries 6 Announcement of Opportunity (AO) sensors: the\nNASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)\nprovided by NASA, Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's\nReflectance (POLDER) provided by CNES, the Interferometric Monitor for\nGreenhouse Gases (IMG) provided by the Ministry of the International\nTrade and Industries, and the Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer\n(ILAS) and Retroreflector in Space (RIS) provided by Environment\nAgency of Japan.\n\nADEOS is a large satellite with a mass of approx. 3500 kg and a power\ngeneration capability of more than 4500 w.  It is made up of\nthermally, electrically and mechanically independent units, which\nfacilitate its integration and testing, including the Communications\nand Data Handling Subsystem (C&DH), the electrical Power Subsystem\n(EPS) and the Attitude and Orbital Control subsystem (AOCS). The\nsatellite features an automatic, autonomous operation function capable\nof operating a large number of mission instruments, and inter orbital\ncommunication equipment to transmit observation data via data relay\nsatellite.\n\nIn august 17 1996 01:53(UT), ADEOS launched into a sun synchronous\nsub-recurrent orbit of an altitude of approx.  830 km by an H-II\nlaunch vehicle from the Tanegashima Space Center.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nADEOS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Dimension Mainbody           Approx. 4*4*5m\n             Solar Array Paddle Approx. 3*24m\n   Mass      Mainbody           Approx. 2300kg\n             Mission Instrument Approx. 1300kg\n   Orbit     Category           Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent orbit\n             Local Sun Time     10:30+-15\n             Recurrent Period   41days\n             Altitude           Approx. 797km\n             Inclination        Approx. 98.6 deg\n             Period             Approx. 101 minutes",
