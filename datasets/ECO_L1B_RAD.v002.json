    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected  FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Top of Atmosphere Calibrated Radiance Instantaneous L1B Global 70 m (ECO_L1B_RAD) Version 2 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values retrieved for five thermal infrared (TIR) bands operating between 8 and 12.5 \u00b5m. Additionally, the digital numbers (DN) for the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band are provided. The TIR bands are spatially co-registered to produce a variable spatial resolution between 70 meters (m) and 90 m at the edge of the swath. The ECO_L1B_RAD data product is provided as swath data and does not contain geolocation information. The corresponding ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L1B_RAD data product. The geographic coverage of acquisitions for the ECO_L1B_RAD Version 2 data product extends to areas outside of those indicated on the coverage map. \r\n\r\nThe ECO_L1B_RAD Version 2 data product contains layers of radiance values for the five TIR bands, DN values for the SWIR band, associated data quality indicators, and ancillary data distributed in HDF5 format. For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for the 8.785 \u03bcm, 10.522 \u03bcm, and 12.001 \u03bcm (TIR) bands only. The 1.6 \u03bcm (SWIR), 8.285 \u03bcm (TIR), and 9.060 \u03bcm (TIR) bands contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS.\r\n",
