    "description": "This data set consists of digital water-table contours for the Mojave River\nBasin.  The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Mojave Water\nAgency, constructed a water-table map of the Mojave River ground-water basin\nfor ground-water levels measured in November 1992.  Water-level data were\ncollected from approximately 300 wells to construct the contours.  The\nwater-table contours were digitized from the paper map which was published at a\nscale of 1:125,000.  The contour interval ranges from 3,200 to 1,600 feet above\nsea level.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
