    "description": "Korean Antarctic survey carried out as part of step 2 project in year 1 of \u2018The Antarctic Undersea Geological Survey\u2019 in 1997 was conducted in a continental shelf in the northwestern part of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThe research period took a total of 8 days, including 6 days for the seismic survey and 2 days for the drilling investigation. \nWe took on lease Norway R/V 'Polar Duke' and 10 researchers from \u2018Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute\u2019 participated as field investigation personnel.\nThe Teac single-channel recorder, EPC Recorder, Q/C MicroMax system etc. was used mainly by Sleeve gun used as a sound source, compressor for creating compressed air, DFS-V Recorder for multi-channel Seismic record, 12 \u2013channel geophone of seismic streamers. Additional Gravity Core was used for sediment research through drilling.",
