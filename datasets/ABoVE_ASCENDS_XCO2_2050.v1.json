    "description": "This dataset provides in situ airborne measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor concentrations, plus air temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed values over Alaska and the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada during 2017-07-20 to 2017-08-08. Measurements were taken onboard a DC-8 aircraft during this Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons (ASCENDS) airborne deployment over portions of the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) domain. CO2 and CH4 were measured with NASA's Atmospheric Vertical Observations of CO2 in the Earth's Troposphere (AVOCET) instrument. Water vapor and relative humidity were measured with Diode Laser Hydrometer. Measurements of column-averaged dry-air mixing ratio CO2 measurements (XCO2) were taken with the CO2 Sounder Lidar instrument. The airborne CO2 Sounder is a pulsed, multi-wavelength Integrated Path Differential Absorption lidar. It estimates XCO2 in the nadir path from the aircraft to the scattering surface by measuring the shape of the 1572.33 nm CO2 absorption line. The data were collected in order to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of the northern high latitude carbon cycle as part of ABoVE and are provided in ICARTT file format.",
