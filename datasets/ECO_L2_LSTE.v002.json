    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous L2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. The ECO_L2_LSTE is provided as swath data and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m). The corresponding  ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L2_LSTE data product.\r\n\r\nThe ECO_L2_LSTE Version 2 data product contains layers of LST, emissivity for bands 1 through 5, quality control for LST&E, LST error, emissivity error for bands 1 through 5, wideband emissivity, Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), cloud mask, and water mask. For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS as mentioned in the Known Issues section.",
