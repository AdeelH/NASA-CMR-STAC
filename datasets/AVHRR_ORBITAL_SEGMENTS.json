    "description": "       The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1-km Orbital\n       Segments data set is a component of the National Aeronautics and\n       Space Administration (NASA) AVHRR Pathfinder Program and contains\n       global coverage of land masses at 1-kilometer resolution.\n\n       The data set is the result of an international effort to acquire,\n       process, and distribute AVHRR data of the entire global land surface\n       to meet the needs of the international science community.  The \n       orbital segments are comprised of raw AVHRR scenes consisting of\n       5-channel, 10-bit, AVHRR data at 1.1-km resolution at nadir.  The raw\n       data are used to produce vegetation index composites; to support fire \n       detection and cloud screening activities; to support research in\n       atmospheric correction; to develop algorithms; and to support a host of\n       research activities that may require the inclusion of raw AVHRR data.\n",
