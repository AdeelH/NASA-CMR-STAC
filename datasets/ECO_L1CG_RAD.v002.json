    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Gridded Top of Atmosphere Calibrated Radiance Instantaneous Level 1C Global 70 m (ECO_L1CG_RAD) Version 2 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values retrieved for five thermal infrared (TIR) bands operating between 8 and 12.5 \u00b5m. This product is a gridded version of the ECO_L1B_RAD (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_RAD.002) Version 2 data product that has been resampled by nearest neighbor, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006\u00b0 grid, and repackaged as the ECO_L1CG_RAD data product.\r\nThe ECO_L1CG_RAD Version 2 data product contains 12 layers distributed in an HDF5 format file containing radiance values for the five TIR bands, associated data quality indicators, and cloud and water masks. For acquisitions between May 15, 2019, and April 28, 2023, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS. Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023. Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS is now routinely acquiring and downlinking all 5-bands of thermal infrared data for the first time since the loss of both on-board Mass Storage Units in 2018 and 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",
