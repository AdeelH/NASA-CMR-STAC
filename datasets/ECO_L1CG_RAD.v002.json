    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally between 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S latitudes. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Gridded Top of Atmosphere Calibrated Radiance Instantaneous Level 1C Global 70 m (ECO_L1CG_RAD) Version 2 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values retrieved for five thermal infrared (TIR) bands operating between 8 and 12.5 \u00b5m. This product is a gridded version of the [ECO_L1B_RAD](https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_RAD.002) Version 2 data product that has been resampled by nearest neighbor, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006\u00b0 grid, and repackaged as the ECO_L1CG_RAD data product.\r\n\r\nThe ECO_L1CG_RAD Version 2 data product contains 12 layers distributed in an HDF5 format file containing radiance values for the five TIR bands, associated data quality indicators, and cloud and water masks. For acquisitions between May 15, 2019, and April 28, 2023, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS, as mentioned in the Known Issues section.",
