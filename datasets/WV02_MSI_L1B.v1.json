    "description": "The WorldView-2 Level 1B Multispectral 8-Band Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies (formerly known as DigitalGlobe) by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery is collected by the DigitalGlobe WorldView-2 satellite using the WorldView-110 camera across the global land surface from October 2009 to the present. This satellite imagery is in the visible and near-infrared waveband range with data in the coastal, blue, green, yellow, red, red edge, and near-infrared (2 bands) wavelengths. It has a spatial resolution of 1.85m at nadir and a temporal resolution of approximately 1.1 days. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) and GeoTIFF formats. This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) license, and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
