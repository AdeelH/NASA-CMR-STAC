    "description": "This dataset provides atmospheric backscattering coefficient profiles collected during Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) deployments from 2017-07-20 to 2017-08-08 over Alaska, U.S., and the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada. These profiles were measured by the CO2 Sounder Lidar instrument carried on a DC-8 aircraft. The airborne CO2 Sounder is a pulsed, multi-wavelength Integrated Path Differential Absorption lidar that estimates column-averaged dry-air CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) in the nadir path from the aircraft to the scattering surface. In addition to XCO2, the lidar receiver recorded the time-resolved atmospheric backscatter signal strength as the laser pulses propagated through the atmosphere. Raw lidar data were converted to the atmospheric backscatter cross-section product and the two-way atmosphere transmission, also known as attenuated backscatter profiles. These ASCENDS flights were coordinated with the 2017 Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) campaign and are provided in ICARTT format.",
