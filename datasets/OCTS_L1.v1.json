    "description": "On August 17, 1996, the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA - National Space Development Agency)\nlaunched the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS). ADEOS was in a descending, Sun\nsynchronous orbit with a nominal equatorial crossing time of 10:30 a.m. Amoung the\ninstruments carried aboard the ADEOS spacecraft was the Ocean Color and Temperature\nScanner (OCTS). OCTS is an optical radiometer with 12 bands covering the visible, near\ninfrared and thermal infrared regions. (Eight of the bands are in the VIS/NIR. These are\nthe only bands calibrated and processed by the OBPG) OCTS has a swath width of\napproximately 1400 km, and a nominal nadir resolution of 700 m. The instrument operated\nat three tilt states (20 degrees aft, nadir and 20 degrees fore), similar to SeaWiFS.",
