    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Cloud Mask Instantaneous L2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2_CLOUD) Version 2 data product is derived using a single-channel Bayesian cloud threshold with a look-up-table (LUT) approach. The ECOSTRESS Level 2 cloud product provides a cloud mask that can be used to determine cloud cover for accurate land surface temperature and evapotranspiration estimation. The corresponding ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L2_CLOUD data product.\r\n \r\nThe ECO_L2_CLOUD Version 2 data product contains three cloud mask layers: brightness temperature LUT test, brightness temperature difference test, and final cloud mask. Information on how to interpret the bit fields in the cloud mask is provided in Table 7 of the User Guide (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1574/ECOL2_User_Guide_V2.pdf).",
