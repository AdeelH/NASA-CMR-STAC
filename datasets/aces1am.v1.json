    "description": "The ACES Aircraft and Mechanical Data consist of aircraft (e.g. pitch, roll, yaw) and mechanical (e.g. aircraft engine speed, tail commands, fuel levels) data recorded by the Altus II Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Altus II UAV) system during the Altus Cumulus Electrification Study (ACES) based at the Naval Air Facility Key West in Florida. ACES aimed to provide extensive observations of the cloud electrification process and its effects by using the Altus II UAV to collect cloud top observations of thunderstorms. The campaign also worked to validate satellite lightning measurements. The Altus II aircraft and mechanical data files are available from July 10 through August 30, 2002 in MATLAB data format (.mat).
