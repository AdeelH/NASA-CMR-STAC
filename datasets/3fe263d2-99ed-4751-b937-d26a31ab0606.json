    "description": "Every day, three successive NOAA-AVHRR scenes are used to derive a synthesis product in stereographic projection known as the \"Normalized Difference Vegetation Index\" for Europe and North Africa. It is calculated by dividing the difference in technical albedos between measurements in the near infrared and visible red part of the spectrum by the sum of both measurements. This value provides important information about the \"greenness\" and density of vegetation. Weekly and monthly thematic synthesis products are also derived from this daily operational product, at each step becoming successively free of clouds.
