    "description": "The IKONOS Panchromatic Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies (formerly known as DigitalGlobe) by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery was collected by the IKONOS satellite using the Optical Sensor Assembly instrument across the global land surface from October 1999 to March 2015. This data product includes panchromatic imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.82m at nadir and a temporal resolution of approximately 3 days. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) and GeoTIFF formats. This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) license, and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
