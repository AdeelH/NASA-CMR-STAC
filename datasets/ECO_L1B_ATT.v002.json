    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science) website.\r\n\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Attitude and Ephemeris Instantaneous Level 1B Global (ECO_L1B_ATT) Version 2 data product provides both corrected and uncorrected attitude quaternions and spacecraft ephemeris data obtained from the ISS. The data are provided in 1 second intervals, and each product file contains vectors from the duration of the orbit. \r\n\r\nThe ECO_L1B_ATT Version 2 data product contains layers of attitude and ephemeris data generated by the ISS, which are used to start the geolocation process. These layers also include Earth-centered inertial (ECI) position and velocity, and associated time elements distributed in HDF5 format.",
