The resulting image was used to digitize benthic, land cover and mangrove habitat maps of the Salt River Bay National Historic Park and Ecological Preserve (National Park Service), on St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.The mosaic is centered on the National Park Service Site, located on the north central coast of St. Croix, and extends beyond the park boundaries approximately 0.5 - 4.0 km.",
