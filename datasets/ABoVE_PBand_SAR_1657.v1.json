    "description": "This dataset provides estimates of soil geophysical properties derived from Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) P-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data collected in August and October of 2014, 2015, and 2017 over 12 study sites (with some exceptions) across Northern Alaska. Soil properties reported include the active layer thickness (ALT), dielectric constant, soil moisture profile, surface roughness, and their respective uncertainty estimates at 30-m spatial resolution over the 12 flight transects. Most of the study sites are located within the continuous permafrost zone and where the aboveground vegetation consisting mainly of dwarf shrub and tussock/sedge/moss tundra has a minimal impact on P-band radar backscatter.",
