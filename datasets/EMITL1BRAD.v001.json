    "description": "The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth\u2019s arid dust source regions. EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS). During its one-year mission, EMIT will take mineralogical measurements of  sunlit regions of interest between 52\u00b0 N latitude and 52\u00b0 S latitude. A map of the regions being investigated can be found on the EMIT website.\r\nThe EMIT Level 1B At-Sensor Calibrated Radiance and Geolocation (EMITL1BRAD) Version 1 data product provides at-sensor calibrated radiance values along with observation data in a spatially raw, non-orthocorrected format. Each EMITL1BRAD granule consists of two Network Common Data Format 4 (NetCDF4) files at a spatial resolution of 60 meters (m): Radiance (EMIT_L1B_RAD) and Observation (EMIT_L1B_OBS). The Radiance file contains the at-sensor radiance measurements of 285 bands with a spectral range of 381-2493 nanometers (nm) and with a spectral resolution of ~7.5 nm, which are held within a single science dataset layer (SDS). The Observation file contains viewing and solar geometries, timing, topographic, and other information related to the observation. \r\nEach NetCDF4 file holds a location group containing geometric lookup tables (GLT), which are orthorectified images that provide relative x and y reference locations from the raw scene to allow for projection of the data. Along with the GLT layers, the files also contain latitude, longitude, and elevation layers. The latitude and longitude coordinates are presented using the World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) ellipsoid. The elevation data was obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission v3 (SRTM v3) data and resampled to EMIT\u2019s spatial resolution.\r\n\r\nThe early release of EMITL1BRAD includes a small representation of EMIT data with limited spatial and temporal coverage to provide the science community with an opportunity to become familiar with the data.
