    "description": "This project involves measuring regional and site variability in maximum annual active layer development and vertical surface movement over permafrost, and monitoring sites over time in order to observe trends. The project records maximum thaw penetration, maximum heave and subsidence, late season snow depths, current depth of thaw, elevation, and soil properties. Some sites are twinned with soil- and air-temperature recording equipment.\n\nThe project includes about 60 monitoring stations extending from Fort Simpson, Canada, in the upper Mackenzie River valley to the Beaufort Sea coast at North Head, Richards Island, Canada. Ten of the sites are part of the IPA's Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) Program. CALM site numbers are in parentheses after the site names: North Head (C3), Taglu (C4), Lousy Point (C5), Reindeer Depot (C7), Rengleng River (C8), Mountain River (C9), Norman Wells (C11), Ochre River (C13), Willowlake River (C14), and Fort Simpson (C15). See the CALM Program Web page for geographic coordinates and site history for all CALM sites.\n\nThese data are the property of the people of Canada and the responsibility of the Geological Survey of Canada. If published, adequate acknowledgment is expected. Please contact F. M. Nixon regarding use of the data set or access to the extended data.",
