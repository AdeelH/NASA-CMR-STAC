    "description": "This dataset contains forest vertical structure and associated uncertainty products derived by applying multi-baseline Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) and Polarimetric Coherence Tomographic SAR (PCT or PC-TomoSAR) techniques. The data were collected from multiple repeat-pass flights over Gabonese forests using the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) instrument in February-March 2016. In addition, supplementary data products based on various intermediate parameters of the UAVSAR data are provided and include radar backscatter, coherence, and viewing and terrain geometry. These data were collected by NASA as part of the joint NASA/ESA AfriSAR campaign.",
