    "description": "The C2S-MS Floods Dataset is a dataset of global flood events with labeled Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 pairs. There are 900 sets (1800 total) of near-coincident Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 chips (512 x 512 pixels) from 18 global flood events. Each chip contains a water label for both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as a cloud/cloud shadow mask for Sentinel-2. The dataset was constructed by Cloud to Street in collaboration with and funded by the Microsoft Planetary Computer team.",
