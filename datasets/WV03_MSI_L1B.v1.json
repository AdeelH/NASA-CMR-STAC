    "description": "The WorldView-3 Level 1B Multispectral 8-Band Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies (formerly known as DigitalGlobe) by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery is collected by the DigitalGlobe WorldView-3 satellite using the WorldView-110 camera across the global land surface from August 2014 to the present. This satellite imagery is in a range of wavebands with data in the coastal, blue, green, yellow, red, red edge, and near-infrared (2 bands) wavelengths. The imagery has a spatial resolution of 1.24m at nadir and a temporal resolution of less than one day. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF). This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) license, and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
