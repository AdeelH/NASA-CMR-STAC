    "description": "MIANCAGP_1 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Ancillary Geographic Product version 1. It is a set of 233 pre-computed files. Each AGP file pertains to a single Terra orbital path. MISR production software relies on information in the AGP, such as digital terrain elevation, as input to the algorithms which generate MISR products. The AGP contains eleven fields of geographical data. This product consists primarily of geolocation data on a Space Oblique Mercator (SOM) Grid. It has 233 parts, corresponding to the 233 repeat orbits of the EOS-AM1 Spacecraft. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.",
