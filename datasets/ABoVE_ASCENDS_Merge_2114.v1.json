    "description": "This dataset provides in situ airborne measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapor concentrations, air temperature, pressure, and wind speed and direction as well as airborne remote sensing measurements of column average CO2 collected during Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) deployments from 2017-07-20 to 2017-08-08 over Alaska, US, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada. CO2 and CH4 were measured with NASA's Atmospheric Vertical Observations of CO2 in the Earth's Troposphere (AVOCET) instrument. Water vapor and relative humidity were measured with Diode Laser Hydrometer. Measurements were taken onboard a DC-8 aircraft. The ASCENDS flights were coordinated with the 2017 Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) campaign. The data are provided in ICARTT format along with an archive of flight videos.",
