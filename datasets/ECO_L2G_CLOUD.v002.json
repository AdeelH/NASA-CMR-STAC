    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Gridded Cloud Mask Instantaneous L2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2G_CLOUD) Version 2 data product is derived using a single-channel Bayesian cloud threshold with a look-up-table (LUT) approach. The ECO_L2G_CLOUD product provides a cloud mask that can be used to determine cloud cover for accurate land surface temperature and evapotranspiration estimation. This data product is a gridded version of the ECO_L2_CLOUD Version 2 product that was resampled using nearest neighbor, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006\u00b0 grid, and repackaged as the ECO_L2G_CLOUD Version 2 data product.\r\nThe ECO_L2G_CLOUD Version 2 data product contains two cloud mask layers: cloud confidence and final cloud mask. Information on how to interpret the cloud confidence and cloud mask layers is provided in Table 7 of the ECO_L2_CLOUD Version 2 User Guide.",
