    "description": "\u201cThe ILRS contribution to ITRF2020 consists of a pair of time series of weekly and bi-weekly station position estimates along with daily and 3-day averaged Earth Orientation Parameters (X-pole, Y-pole and excess Length-Of-Day (LOD)) estimated over 7-day arcs (1993.0 \u2013 2021.0) and 15-day arcs for the period 1983.0-1993.0, aligned to the calendar weeks (Sunday to Saturday), starting from January 1983. Each solution is obtained through the combination of loosely constrained weekly/biweekly solutions submitted by each of the seven official ILRS Analysis Centers. Both, the individual and combined solutions have followed strict standards agreed upon within the ILRS Analysis Standing Committee (ASC) to provide ITRS products of the highest possible quality.\u201d (The ILRS contribution to ITRF2020, E. C. Pavlis (GESTAR II/UMBC & NASA Goddard 61A) and V. Luceri (e-GEOS S.p.A., ASI/CGS))",
