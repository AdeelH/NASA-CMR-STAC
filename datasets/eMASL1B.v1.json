    "description": "The Enhanced Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (eMAS)instrument is maintained and operated by the Airborne Sensor Facility at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, under the oversight of the EOS Project Science Office at NASA Goddard. Prior to 1995, the MAS was deployed on the NASA's ER-2 and C-130 aircraft platforms using a 12-channel, 8-bit data system that somewhat constrained the full benefit of having a 50-channel scanning spectrometer. Beginning in January 1995, a 50-channel, 16-bit digitizer was used on the ER-2 platform, which greatly enhanced the capability of MAS to simulate MODIS data over a wide range of environmental conditions. Recently, it has undergone extensive upgrades to the optics and other components. New detectors have been installed and the spectral bands have been streamlined. The eMAS instrument is now a 38-channel instrument, sensing in the range from 0.445 to 13.844 um.\r\n\r\nFor more information and for a list of MAS campaign flights  visit ladsweb at:\r\n\r\nhttps://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/mas/\r\n\r\nor, visit the eMAS Homepage at:\r\n\r\nhttps://asapdata.arc.nasa.gov/emas/",
