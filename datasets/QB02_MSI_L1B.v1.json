    "description": "The QuickBird Level 1B Multispectral 4-Band Imagery collection contains satellite imagery acquired from Maxar Technologies by the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program. Imagery was collected by the DigitalGlobe QuickBird-2 satellite using the Ball High Resolution Camera 60 across the global land surface from October 2001 to January 2015. This satellite imagery is in the visible and near-infrared waveband range with data in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths. The spatial resolution is 2.16m at nadir and the temporal resolution is 2.5 to 5.6 days. The data are provided in National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) and GeoTIFF formats. This level 1B data is sensor corrected and is an un-projected (raw) product. The data potentially serve a wide variety of applications that require high resolution imagery. Data access is restricted based on a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) license, and investigators must be approved by the CSDA Program.",
