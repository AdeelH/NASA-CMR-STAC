    "description": "The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth\u2019s arid dust source regions. EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS). During its one-year mission, EMIT will take mineralogical measurements of the sunlit regions of interest between 52\u00b0 N latitude and 52\u00b0 S latitude. A map of the regions being investigated can be found on the EMIT website. The EMIT Level 1B Corrected Spacecraft Attitude and Ephemeris (EMITL1BATT) Version 1 data product provides both corrected and uncorrected attitude quaternions and spacecraft ephemeris data obtained from the ISS, including Earth-centered inertial (ECI) position and velocity, and associated time elements. The data are provided in 1 second intervals, and each product file contains vectors from the duration of the orbit. The time elements are copied from the ISS raw data. The data for each EMITL1BATT granule are delivered in a single Network Common Data Format 4 (NetCDF4) file.",
