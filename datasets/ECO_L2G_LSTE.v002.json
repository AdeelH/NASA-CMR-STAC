    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected [FLUXNET](https://fluxnet.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science). The ECOSTRESS Gridded Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous Level 2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2G_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2G_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. This data product is a gridded version of the [ECO_L2_LSTE](https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L2_LSTE.002) Version 2 data product that was resampled using nearest neighbor, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006\u00b0 grid, and repackaged as the ECO_L2G_LSTE data product. The ECO_L2G_LSTE product is provided as gridded data and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m). The ECO_L2G_LSTE Version 2 data product contains 8 layers distributed in an HDF5 format file including LST, LST error, wideband emissivity, height, view zenith angle, quality flags, and cloud and water masks. For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS, as mentioned in the Known Issues section. LST data generated after May 15, 2019, will use only the three available bands; accuracy may be affected when compared to the LST data that utilized all five bands.",
