    "description": "This document presents the Concise Experiment Plan for NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) to serve as a guide to the Program as it identifies the research to be conducted under this study. Research for ABoVE will link field-based, process-level studies with geospatial data products derived from airborne and satellite remote sensing, providing a foundation for improving the analysis and modeling capabilities needed to understand and predict ecosystem responses and societal implications. The ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan (ACEP) outlines the conceptual basis for the Field Campaign and expresses the compelling rationale explaining the scientific and societal importance of the study. It presents both the science questions driving ABoVE research as well as the top-level requirements for a study design to address them.",
