    "description": "\nThis dataset produced by the NASA Harvest team includes crop types labels from ground referencing matched with time-series of Sentinel-2 imagery during the growing season. Ground reference data are collected using an ODK app. Crop types include Maize, Millet, Rice and Sorghum. Labels are vectorized over the Sentinel-2 grid, and provided as raster files. Funding for this dataset is provided by Lutheran World Relief, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and University of Maryland NASA Harvest program.",
