    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website.\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Tiled Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous Level 2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2T_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2T_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. This tiled data product is subset from the ECO_L2G_LSTE data product using a modified version of the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) which divides Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zones into square tiles that are 109.8 km by 109.8 km with a 70 meter (m) spatial resolution.\r\nThe ECO_L2T_LSTE Version 2 data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate COG. This product contains seven layers including LST, LST error, wideband emissivity, quality flags, height, and cloud and water masks. For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS, as mentioned in the Known Issues section. LST data generated after May 15, 2019 will only use the three available bands, accuracy may be affected when compared to the LST data that utilized all five bands.",
