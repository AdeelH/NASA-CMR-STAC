    "description": " Abstract: The Landsat Orthorectified data collection consists of a global\n                set of high-quality, relatively cloud-free orthorectified MSS, TM and ETM+ imagery\n                from Landsats 1-5 and 7. This dataset was selected and generated through NASA's\n                Commercial Remote Sensing Program, as part of a cooperative effort between NASA and\n                the commercial remote sensing community to provide users with access to\n                quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images with global coverage over the\n                Earth's land masses. The data collection was compiled via NASA contract with Earth\n                Satellite Corporation (Rockville, MD) in association with NASA's Scientific Data\n                Purchase program. The Landsat Orthorectified data collection consists of\n                approximately 7,500 MSS (Landsat 1-5) images, 7,461 TM (Landsat 4-5) images and\n                approximately 8,500 ETM+ (Landsat 7) images, which were selected to provide two full\n                sets of global coverage over an approximate 10-year interval (circa 1990 and circa\n                2000). All selected images were either cloud-free or contained minimal cloud cover.\n                In addition, only images with a high quality ranking in regards to the possible\n                presence of errors such as missing scans or saturated bands were selected. Purpose:\n                To provide users with access to quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images\n                with global coverage over the Earth's land masses. Supplemental_Information: The\n                average acquisition date for the Landsat Orthorectified ETM+ data is 2000 (+/- 1\n                year). All scenes were acquired between 1999 and 2001. These data have been\n                orthorectified for coregistration with the earlier (circa 1990) Landsat TM coverage.",
