    "description": "Korean Antarctic survey carried out as part of step 2 project in year 2 of 'the Antarctic Undersea Geological Survey' was conducted in the \u2161 region around the northwestern continent of the Antarctic Peninsula. This area is northwest of Anvers Island, including areas around the pericontinent from the continental shelf to the continental rise zone. The investigation period for this project took a total of 8 days for moving navigation, the survey of the side lines and drilling investigation.\nAfter seismic investigation, a surface drilling investigation was conducted in coring point was decided from the reference seismic section. \n10 researcher from \u2018Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute\u2019 participated in the field survey. We took on lease Russian icebreaker \"Yuzhmorgeologiya\".",
